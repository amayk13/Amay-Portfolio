# [Project 2: CDC API Data Analysis and Modeling](https://github.com/amayk13/Airbnb-and-CDC-projects)

- Aggregated and cleaned COVID-19 cases & vaccine data from CDC APIs (5 unique API's)
- Created multiple linear and random forest regression model for predicting allocation (Dose) based on cases, deaths, and population (93% accuracy highest).
- Compared K means, DBScan, and Mean shift models for the best fit.
- Mean shift and DBScan perform the best slightly having an edge over K means.
